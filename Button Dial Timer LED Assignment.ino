//TASK: Create a circuit where when a button is pressed an LED will turn on.  This also triggers a timer which will determine how long the LED will stay lit. A dial (potentiometer) used to control the time.

int buttonPin = 2; //button connected to digital pin 2
int buttonState = 0; //initialize variable, set button state to off
int pressed = 1; //HIGH represented as variable to simplify code
int lock = 0; //Pressing the button again once the timer is started doesn't affect it
int blueLED = 10; //blue LED, connected to pin 10
int yellowLED = 12; //yellow LED, connected to pin 12
int greenLED = 11; //green LED, connected to pin 11
int redLED = LED_BUILTIN; //red LED, connected to builtin LED pin
int potPin = A0; //potentiometer connected to A0 analog pin
int potVal = 0;//read value of potentiometer pin
int lightUpDuration = 0; //length of timer in ms, selected by dial
long totalTime = 0; //keeps track of target time for LED countdown. Using long instead of int, so that the value doesn't overflow. https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/long/
long storedMillis = 0; //needed for LED countdown. Using long instead of int to ensure it doesn't overflow. While debugging via serial monitor output, I found that storedMillis turned negative which broke the countdown, only ever ligting up the blue LED.
//Arduino UNO stores 2 byte value for int, a range of -32,768 to 32,767. That is insufficent for this circuit given that 1000ms is 1 second, so the circuit could only run for up to 32.7 seconds before it breaks. Whereas long goes up to 2 billion.

//TURN ON AND TURN OFF LEDs, DISPLAYING COUNTDOWN EFFECT
//Explanation: to get the countdown effect working for the 4 LEDs each LED turns on at 4 intervals. specifically, when 100% of the timer remains, when 75% remains, 50% remains, 25%, and lastly 0%.
//Example: 2000ms millis & dial set to 5000ms. all the LEDs will turn off once millis reaches 7000ms. there are 4 LEDs so divide dial time by 4 (5000/4 = 1000). immediately after pressing button, blue LED is lit.
//then, when millis reaches 4000ms, green LED is lit. At 5000ms, yellow LED is lit. 6000ms, red LED is lit. at 7000ms, all LEDs are turned off.
